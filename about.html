            My name is Amelia, I am a multifaceted freelance
            and graphic artist. My work has ranged from logo
            and company design to pallets and original
            characters for use in DnD and MMORPGs, also for
            use in novels and fanfictions. I have created art
            and designs for youtube channels, games and novels.
            I currently work as a logo designer for a Facebook
            page and group, to design their profile images and
            banners, and as the graphic designer for AmeCat Games.
            While most of my work is in pixels or pencil, I dabble
            in every artistic medium I can find. I currently am
            experimenting in watercolors and ink.
